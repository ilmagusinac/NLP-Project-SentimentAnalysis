*NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING - GOOGLE PLAY REVIEWS AND REPLIES SENTIMENT ANALYSIS*
- The project aims to analyse Google Playstore Reviews and Replies dataset that is taken from Kaggel, and do natural language processing tasks to in what way do the reviews and replies answer the questions of the probability of correct interpretation.
- The data contains over 12000 reviews of different app store applications by real users. As well as the rating that was given by them so it can be classified into positive or negative reviews.
- Twelve columns that make up the dataset are: 'reviewId' 'userName', 'userImage', 'content', 'score', 'thumbsUpCount' 'reviewCreatedVersion', 'at', 'replyContent', 'repliedAt', 'sortOrder' and 'appId'.
